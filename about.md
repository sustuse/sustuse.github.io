We are the research group for Sustainable Use of Natural Resources at the University of Marburg. Our research agenda combines methods and topics from environmental-, development- and behavioral-economics. More specifically, we apply economic  experimental techniques carried out in the field to study questions related to the nature of pro-social and anti-social preferences in different contexts and the effectiveness of institutions for governance of natural resources, collective action or risk-sharing networks in developing countries. Do social preferences of individuals change due to context conditions? And if so, how does this interact with policies and institutions? These are also central questions of his most recent research project, which focuses on the impacts of climate change on human behavior.
